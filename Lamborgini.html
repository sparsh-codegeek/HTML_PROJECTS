            Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (Italian pronunciation: [autoˈmɔːbili lamborˈɡiːni])
            is an Italian manufacturerof luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese.
            The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi.
            Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916–1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili 
            Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari.
            The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.
            Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake
            of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis.
            The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978.
            American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to 
            Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994
            . In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was 
            placed under the control of the group's Audi division.
