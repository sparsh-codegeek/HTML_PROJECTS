        <h1>1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail</h1>
        <h3>Rolls Royce is known for its luxury cars. The new Boat Tail looks exquisite,
             it is a successor to the gorgeous Sweptail that was produced in 2017. 
             The Sweptail cost $12.8 million. The company hasn’t announced the pricing yet,
              but the rumours say that the Boat Tail is supposed to be a whopping $28 million. 
              The exterior of the Boat Tail is two-toned, which is not seen on many cars, 
              the finishing is high-end, and the interior comes with a “hosting suite” with a 
              built-in sun umbrella and champagne fridge. Who doesn’t love champagne, right? 
              Rolls Royce never disappoints.</h3><br>

        <h1>2. Buggati La Voiture Noire</h1>
        <h3>Buggati La Voiture Noire comes with the quad-turbo 8 litre W16 engine. 
            It produces 1479 horsepower and 1600 newton-metres of torque. One can 
            find it hard to believe, but this car comes with six exhaust tips. 
            The swanky new Buggati La Voiture Noire comes with radical wheels, the 
            fascia is bespoke, and the badge at the backlights up to spell the name 
            of the brand, making it evidently Buggati. La Voiture Noire is a tribute 
            to the history of the legendary Buggati. It stands for sophistication and elegance. 
            It brings speed, aesthetics, luxury, and technology and is nothing short of an icon. 
            This all-black Atlantic is priced at $18.7 million.</h3>

        <h1>3. Buggati Centodieci</h1>
        <h3>The Centodieci is a really rare car, it was debuted by Buggati in Pebble Beach car week. The Centodieci builds on Bugatti’s 110-year tradition of excellent design and performance while also honouring the brand’s recent heritage. Bugatti designed a recreation of the epochal EB110 with the Centodieci – Italian for 110. With its astounding performance and pioneering design, the Centodieci, inspired by the historical model, challenges all bounds of creativity. The Centodieci, with its modern version of the classic wedge shape and the renowned W16 engine, tastefully ushers the EB110 into the new millennium. There are only 10 units produced and the 10 limited-edition cars are distinguished by their flawless elegance and sculptural beauty, transforming the Centodieci into a true work of art. The car is one of the most exclusive cars ever made and it is priced at $9 million.</h3>
