        <h1>1. Rolls-Royce Boat Tail</h1>
        <h3>Rolls Royce is known for its luxury cars. The new Boat Tail looks exquisite,
             it is a successor to the gorgeous Sweptail that was produced in 2017. 
             The Sweptail cost $12.8 million. The company hasn’t announced the pricing yet,
              but the rumours say that the Boat Tail is supposed to be a whopping $28 million. 
              The exterior of the Boat Tail is two-toned, which is not seen on many cars, 
              the finishing is high-end, and the interior comes with a “hosting suite” with a 
              built-in sun umbrella and champagne fridge. Who doesn’t love champagne, right? 
              Rolls Royce never disappoints.</h3><br>
